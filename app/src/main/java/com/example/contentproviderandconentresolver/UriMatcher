What is UriMatcher?

UriMatcher is a utility class used to match Uri objects against specific patterns. This is commonly
used in ContentProviders to determine what action to take based on the URI that is passed to the provider.

1. UriMatcher Object Initialization
kotlin
Copy code
private val uriMatcher = UriMatcher(UriMatcher.NO_MATCH)
UriMatcher(UriMatcher.NO_MATCH): This creates a new UriMatcher object. The parameter UriMatcher.NO_MATCH is a constant with a value of -1.
It is used to indicate that no match was found. Initially, the UriMatcher is set up with no patterns, so it will return NO_MATCH if queried.
2. apply { ... } Block
kotlin
Copy code
.apply {
    addURI(AUTHORITY, NOTES_TABLE, 1)
    addURI(AUTHORITY, NOTES_TABLE.plus("#"), 2)
}
The apply block is used to configure the UriMatcher object after it's been created. It allows you to call multiple methods on the object within the block.
3. addURI Method
kotlin
Copy code
addURI(AUTHORITY, NOTES_TABLE, 1)
addURI(AUTHORITY, NOTES_TABLE.plus("#"), 2)
addURI(String authority, String path, int code): This method is used to add a URI pattern to the UriMatcher. It takes three arguments:
authority: This is the authority part of the URI, which usually represents the Content Provider.
path: This is the path part of the URI, which specifies the data you're interested in. It can be a specific table, a row, or some other resource.
code: This is the integer code that will be returned when a URI matches this pattern. It helps identify what the URI represents.
First addURI(AUTHORITY, NOTES_TABLE, 1):
AUTHORITY: This is the authority string for the Content Provider (e.g., "com.example.app.provider").
NOTES_TABLE: This is a string representing the path (e.g., "notes"). It usually corresponds to a table name in your database.
1: The code 1 is returned when a URI with the specified authority and path (NOTES_TABLE) is matched.
Second addURI(AUTHORITY, NOTES_TABLE.plus("#"), 2):
NOTES_TABLE.plus("#"): This pattern includes a wildcard (#), which matches any numerical value. The # wildcard is often used to match specific rows by their ID (e.g., "notes/1" would match the row with ID 1).
2: The code 2 is returned when a URI with the specified authority and a path matching NOTES_TABLE/ID (where ID is a number) is matched.
Summary of the UriMatcher Configuration:
NOTES_TABLE (e.g., "notes"): Matches the URI "content://AUTHORITY/notes" and returns the code 1.
NOTES_TABLE.plus("#") (e.g., "notes/#"): Matches the URI "content://AUTHORITY/notes/ID" (where ID is a number) and returns the code 2.
Example Use Case:
Suppose you have a ContentProvider for notes. You might define URIs like:

content://com.example.app.provider/notes to represent all notes.
content://com.example.app.provider/notes/1 to represent a specific note with ID 1.
With this UriMatcher, when you receive a URI, you can easily determine whether it corresponds to the entire table or a specific row, and handle the query, update, or delete operation accordingly.
